Full-text search is a technique for searching words or phrases across a large set of textual data.
Unlike traditional queries that require exact matches, full-text search tries to understand what you’re searching for and bring up the best results.
It is widely used in applications like search engines, e-commerce platforms, documentation searches, and content management systems.

## Understanding text indexes

A full-text index is fundamentally different from a regular database index.
Instead of simply mapping fields to values, it:

- Tokenizes text (splits them into words or phrases).
- Removes stop words (such as "is", "the", "and").
- Applies stemming (so "running" and "run" are treated as the same).
- Assigns weights based on frequency, importance, or custom ranking logic.

FerretDB supports full-text search capabilities.

A full-text search index creation takes the following parameters:

| Field            | Description                                                                                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| name             | A custom name for the index, useful for reference.                                         |
| weights          | Assigns weighting to fields (higher values mean more relevance in search). Default is `1`. |
| default_language | Specifies the language used for stemming (default: "english").                             |
| caseSensitive    | Enables case-sensitive search.                                                             |

:::note
FerretDB only supports one text index per collection.

## Single full-text index

Single full-text index is created on a single field in a collection.

### Creating a text index

To create a text index, use the `createIndex` command with the field you want to index and the type set to `'text'`.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->

<CodeBlock language="js">{CreateIndex}</CodeBlock>

This command creates a full-text index on the `summary` field in a `books` collection.

Insert the following documents into the `books` collection:

<CodeBlock language="js">{MyDataSet}</CodeBlock>

### Performing a full-text search

Let's run a basic full-text search query to find all documents that contain the word "drama" in the `summary` field.

<CodeBlock language="js">{SearchQuery}</CodeBlock>

This query returns all documents where the `summary` field contains the word "drama".

<CodeBlock language="js">{TextSearchResponse}</CodeBlock>

## Compound text index

Compound text index creates an index on multiple fields.
Ensure to drop the existing index before creating a new one.

Let's create a compound text index on the `title` and `summary` fields.

<CodeBlock language="js">{CompoundIndex}</CodeBlock>

## Relevance score

When you perform a full-text search, a relevance score is assigned to each document based on how well it matches the search query.
Relevance scores are calculated based on factors like word frequency, proximity, and custom weights.
Higher scores indicate better relevance.

Let's search for books that contain the words "hunt whales" in the `summary` field and return the relevance score.

<CodeBlock language="js">{RelevanceScore}</CodeBlock>

Even though the query does not have exact matches, the search returns documents that contain similar words.

<CodeBlock language="js">{RelevanceScoreResponse}</CodeBlock>
