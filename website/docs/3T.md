# Using Studio 3T with FerretDB

<!--
    blah blah blah
-->

[Studio 3T](https://studio3t.com/) is an IDE, client and a set of GUI tools for
MongoDB. Studio 3T can also be used with FerretDB with certain limitations outlined below.

## Connecting Studio 3T to FerretDB

Go to the Studio 3T [Connection Manager](https://studio3t.com/knowledge-base/articles/connect-to-mongodb/) and select New Connection:

FerretDB currently only supports PLAIN authentication so please select LDAP (PLAIN) -
Studio 3T Ultimate in the Authentication tab if you need to authenticate to the
database.

You may also choose to specify a connection URI by clicking New Connection and pasting your connection URI. Please use the [Standard Connection String Format](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/#standard-connection-string-format).

See below as an example which connects to `localhost` on port `27017`. It uses the user `username` and password `password` with which to authenticate to FerretDB and specifies the PLAIN authentication mechanism.

Even though it is possible to set all the [TLS Options](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/reference/options/#tls-options) and [Authentication Options](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/reference/options/#authentication-options) in the connection string itself, it is a little cumbersome to do so. Luckily Studio 3T allows us to set these options in various tabs within the UI.

## Setting the Root CA certificate

Go to the SSL tab on the Connection dialog.

Click on the Use own Root CA file checkbox. Then click on the folder icon that follows the file name field. Now you can browse to the CA Certificate file and select it.

You can also select a `.pem` file for the client certificate. Note that all [SSL Options](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v6.0/tutorial/configure-ssl-clients/#mongosh-configuration--using-ssl-options-) have been deprecated since 4.2. You may refer to the [TLS Options](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v6.0/tutorial/configure-ssl-clients/#mongosh-configuration--using-tls-options-) instead.

Once you have configured the appropriate TLS settings click Test Connection and Save.
