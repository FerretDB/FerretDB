# Known differences

<!--
   Each numbered point should have a corresponding test file in https://github.com/FerretDB/dance/tree/main/tests/diff
   Bullet subpoints should be in the same file as the parent point.
-->

1. FerretDB uses the same protocol error names and codes, but the exact error messages may be different in some cases.
2. FerretDB does not support NUL (`\0`) characters in strings.
3. FerretDB does not support nested arrays.
4. FerretDB converts `-0` (negative zero) to `0` (positive zero).
5. Document restrictions:
   - document keys must not contain `.` sign;
   - document keys must not start with `$` sign;
   - document fields of double type must not contain `Infinity`, `-Infinity`, or `NaN` values.
6. When insert command is called, insert documents must not have duplicate keys.
7. Update command restrictions:
   - update operations producing `Infinity`, `-Infinity`, or `NaN` are not supported.
8. Database and collection names restrictions:
   - name cannot start with the reserved prefix `_ferretdb_`;
   - database name must not include non-latin letters;
   - collection name must be valid UTF-8 characters;
9. FerretDB offers the same validation rules for the `scale` parameter in both the `collStats` and `dbStats` commands.
   If an invalid `scale` value is provided in the `dbStats` command, the same error codes will be triggered as with the `collStats` command.
