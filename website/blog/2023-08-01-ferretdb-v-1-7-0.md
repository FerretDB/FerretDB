![FerretDB v.1.7.0 release](/img/blog/ferretdb-v1.7.0.jpg)

We are delighted to announce the release of FerretDB v1.7.0 with the implementation of the `$sum` aggregator standard operator, as well improvement to our backend architecture with basic metrics, logging, and tracing for the SQLite backend.

<!--truncate-->

In past few weeks, we've been improving the SQLite backend architecture, and we're very close to providing a stable and production-ready release for our users.
Working on SQLite backend support has been a great experience for our team, and it enables us to explore better architecture improvements even for the PostgreSQL backend.

In addition to SQLite, we're working with our friends at SAP on providing HANA backend support.
FerretDB is also looking at adding support for other backends in the future, while enabling compatibility with more applications.

Community is the core of everything we do at [FerretDB](https://www.ferretdb.io), so we are pretty excited to have two new first-time contributors, [@Aditya1404Sal](https://github.com/Aditya1404Sal) and [@KrishnaSindhur](https://github.com/KrishnaSindhur), whose contributions were important to this release.

Let's find out more about this release.

## New features

In FerretDB v1.7.0, we've added support for the standard `$sum` operator; this is different from the previously implemented `$sum` as an accumulation operator, which behaves differently when used in other stages.
Now you can use the standard `$sum` operator consistently in any of our supported stages, for aggregation projection, query projection, and for `$group` stage `_id` expression.

We've also added basic metrics, logging, and tracing for the SQLite backend, which should provide more visibility and control to your databases.

## Bug fixes and documentation

There was an error when opening a connection with the MongoDB client in C#, but we've resolved it now by fixing PLAIN authentication with the C# driver.
We've improved the [FerretDB documentation page](https://docs.ferretdb.io/), and now you can find information about SQLite URI parameters, and updated tag formatting in the writing guide.
We've also made it easier to add new linter checks; for example, we included a check for tags with spaces.

## Other changes
