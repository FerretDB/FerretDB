# The Process

This file contains some process notes for FerretDB Inc. engineers and long-term contributors.
If you are a community contributor, feel free to ignore all this!
We will do all that for you so you can focus on what is really interesting for you.

## Pull requests

1. Pull request **title** should be accurate and descriptive as it is used in the generated changelog.
   It should not end with a dot.
   It should not mention the issue number but describe the fixed issue instead.
2. Pull request **description** typically just mentions the issue number like "Refs #123." or "Closes #456." (do not use `https://github.com/org/repo/issue/123` even if it is rendered the same on GitHub).
   End sentences with a dot.
3. Commits messages (both titles and bodies) are not important and can be "WIP" or anything else.
   All commits are squashed on merge.
   Autogenerated squash commit's title and body should be manually replaced by PR's title and description; that includes both manual merges and auto-merges.
   Do not leave original commit messages in the squashed commit body.

## Calls `to show and/or to explain`

Having a call with someone explaining something what you already know and sharing knowledge with someone else, please multiply this knowledge to the benefit of others by writing a detailed article about the topic. Single 1-1 calls are good to check what you might have missed in the way - what seemed to you obvious and to other is not.

Please also gather other people ideas since diversity and different opinoins expand our understanding and vision of the project.
