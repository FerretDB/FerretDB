# Docker

## Provided images

We provide three official Docker images:

* [Production image](https://ghcr.io/ferretdb/ferretdb) `ghcr.io/ferretdb/ferretdb`.
* [Development image](https://ghcr.io/ferretdb/ferretdb-dev) `ghcr.io/ferretdb/ferretdb-dev`.
* [All-in-one image](https://ghcr.io/ferretdb/all-in-one) `ghcr.io/ferretdb/all-in-one`.

The last one is provided for quick testing and experiments and is unsuitable for production use cases.
It is documented in the [FerretDB repository](https://github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB#quickstart).

The development images contain the debug build of FerretDB with test coverage instrumentation, race detector,
and other changes that make it more suitable for debugging problems.
In general, the production image should be used since it is faster and smaller.
The following instructions use it, but the development image could be used in exactly the same way.

## Setup with Docker Compose

The following steps describe a quick local setup:

1. Store the following in the `docker-compose.yml` file:

   ```yaml
   services:
     postgres:
       image: postgres
       environment:
         - POSTGRES_USER=username
         - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
         - POSTGRES_DB=ferretdb
       volumes:
         - ./data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

     ferretdb:
       image: ghcr.io/ferretdb/ferretdb
       ports:
         - 27017:27017
       environment:
         - FERRETDB_POSTGRESQL_URL=postgres://postgres:5432/ferretdb

   networks:
     default:
       name: ferretdb
   ```

   `postgres` container runs PostgreSQL that would store data in the `./data` directory on the host.
   `ferretdb` runs FerretDB.

2. Start services with `docker compose up -d`.
3. If you have `mongosh` installed, just run it to connect to FerretDB.
   It will use credentials passed in `mongosh` flags or MongoDB URI to authenticate to the PostgreSQL database.
   You'll also need to set `authMechanism` to `PLAIN`.
   The example URI would look like:

   ```text
   mongodb://username:password@127.0.0.1/ferretdb?authMechanism=PLAIN
   ```

   See [Authentication](../security.md#authentication) for more details.

   If you don't have `mongosh`, run the following command to run it inside the temporary MongoDB container,
   attaching to the same Docker network:

   ```sh
   docker run --rm -it --network=ferretdb --entrypoint=mongosh mongo \
     "mongodb://username:password@ferretdb/ferretdb?authMechanism=PLAIN"
   ```

You can improve that setup by:

* [securing connections with TLS](../security.md#securing-connections-with-tls);
* adding backups.
