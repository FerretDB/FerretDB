# Insert operation

The insert operation adds a new document to a collection.

## Insert a single document

The `insertOne()` command is used to add a single document into a collection, using this syntax format `db.collection.insertOne({field1: value1, field2: value2,.... fieldN: valueN})`.

The example below depicts how a single document can be added to a collection.

```bash
db.scientists.insertOne({name:{firstname: "Thomas", lastname: "Edison"}, born: 1847, invention: "lightbulb"})
```

If the operation is successful, you will get a response with acknowledged set to true, and the autogenerated ObjectId of the document.

:::note
If a collection does not exist, the insert command automatically creates one.
:::

## Insert many documents at once

A collection can contain multiple documents. Using the `insertMany()` command, you can add multiple documents to a collection at once.

```bash
db.collection_name.insertMany([{document1}, {document2},... {documentN}])
```

The following example shows how to insert multiple documents into a collection:

```bash
db.scientists.insertMany([{name:{firstname: "Alan", lastname: "Turing"}, born: 1912, invention: "Turing Machine"},{name:{firstname: "Graham", lastname: "Bell"}, born: 1847, invention: "telephone"},{name:{firstname: "Ada", lastname: "Lovelace"}, born: 1815, invention: "computer programming"}])
```

You can retrieve all the documents in the collection with this command: `db.scientists.find({})`
