# MangoDB

MangoDB is set out to become the de facto open-source alternative of MongoDB. MangoDB is an open-source proxy, which converts MongoDB wire protocol queries to SQL, and uses PostgreSQL as a database engine.

## Why do we need MangoDB?

MongoDB is a life-changing technology for many Developers, empowering them to build applications faster than using relational databases. It's easy to use and well documented drivers makes MongoDB one of the easiest to use database solutions out there.
However, MongoDB abandoned its Open Source roots, changing the license to SSPL making it unusable for many Open Source and Commercial Projects. 

Most MongoDB users are not in need of many of the advanced features offered by MongoDB, however, they are in the need of an open-source database solution. Recognizing this, the project is here to fill the gap by providing an alternative.

## Scope

MangoDB will be compatible with MongoDB drivers and will work as a drop-in replacement for MongoDB in many cases.

## Current state

What you are seeing here is a tech demoo, intended to show proof of concept. In the next couple months, we will be working on adding more  See [this example](https://github.com/MangoDB-io/example) for a short demonstration.

MangoDB is in a very early stage and welcomes all contributors.
