![FerretDB v1.0 GA](/img/blog/ferretdb-v1.0.jpg)

On behalf of the FerretDB team, we are delighted to announce the release of FerretDB 1.0 GA.

<!--truncate-->

This release is a tremendous milestone representing all the efforts and hard work our amazing team has put in over the past year.
Additionally, we're grateful for the community's overwhelming support, contributions, and feedback since we began this undertaking.

Our mission remains the same: to provide an open-source document database with MongoDB compatibility.
With this release, we're ecstatic to say that FerretDB is production-ready!

FerretDB 1.0 GA includes all the core functionalities of a document database for production use.
It boasts improved performance and stability over previous releases.
You can quickly [get started here](https://docs.ferretdb.io/quickstart-guide/).

## Going from Beta to FerretDB 1.0 GA

With [FerretDB](https://www.ferretdb.io/), you have an easy-to-use, developer-friendly, open-source, and production-ready replacement for all your MongoDB workloads.

Since our Beta release in January, we‚Äôve added some notable features such as client TLS validation, support for aggregation pipelines, authentication for PostgreSQL, and Tigris authentication.
In the meantime, we've also pushed more queries to the backend, optimizing them for faster performance.

Along with improved database backend support for [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [Tigris](https://www.tigrisdata.com/), and [SAP Hana](https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/hana.html), we're also working on adding other backend support in the future.

In addition, we‚Äôre also improving compatibility and enabling more applications, such as [Mingo](https://mingo.io/), [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/), [NoSQLBooster](https://nosqlbooster.com/), and [Studio 3T](https://studio3t.com/), to leverage FerretDB functionalities.
Please find a list of all compatible products here (Link to documentation & listed products).

We are proud to announce that FerretDB now has:

* üë®üèª‚Äçüíª Over 30 code contributors with more than 130 merged pull requests from our community of contributors
* ‚≠êÔ∏è over 5.3k Stars on GitHub
* ‚è´ More than 180 Docker hub downloads
* üî• Over 60 running instances
* ‚è´ Over 10k FerretDB downloads

Let‚Äôs look at some of the latest features and changes in this GA release.

## What‚Äôs new?

In this GA release, FerretDB now supports the `createIndexes` command.
This will enable you to specify the fields you want to index, and also the type of index to use (e.g. ascending, descending, or hashed).

For instance, suppose you have a `users` collection containing several fields, including "age", "name", and "email", and you want to create an index on the "age" field.
You can now run the following command:

```js
db.users.createIndex({ age: 1 })
```

This will create an ascending index on the "age" field, which will speed up any queries that filter on that field.

We've also added the `dropIndexes` command, which allows you to remove an index from a collection.
Here's an example:

```js
db.users.dropIndex({ age: 1 })
```

This will remove the index from the "users" collection.

We have expanded our aggregation pipeline functionality to include additional stages, such as `$unwind`, `$limit` and `$skip`, in addition to the `$sum` accumulator within the `$group` stage.
With these additions, we can perform more refined calculations and manipulations of collection data.
In addition to these, we also added support for `count` and `storageStats` fields in `$collStats` aggregation pipeline stage.

To help you gather more information about your collections, databases, and server performance, we've enabled partial support for several server commands, including `collStats`, `dbStats`, and `dataSize`.

To retrieve statistics about a collection, use the `collStats` command like this:

```js
db.runCommand({ collStats: "users" })
```

If the statistics is about the database, run the command below:

```js
db.runCommand({ dbStats: 1 })
```

For the total data size of a collection, run the following command:

```js
db.runCommand({ dataSize: "<database>.<collection>" })
```
