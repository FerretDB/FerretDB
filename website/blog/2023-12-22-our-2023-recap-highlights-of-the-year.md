What an amazing year we've had at FerretDB!

From our very first production release to adding a new backend support, to a new architecture, the FerretDB team and community has been nothing but outstanding!

We set a mission for ourselves – to create a true open source alternative to MongoDB – and we're delighted to see the progress we've made so far.

All of this, however, would not be possible without the open source community.
From the very first day, we've had tremendous support – code contributors, bug reports, feature requets, partner blog posts, early adopters, and many more.

We were also part of many events across many countries, including the UK, Portugal, Morocco, and the US.
There's just so many highlights!

So as we head into 2024, we are going through all the highlights of the year at FerretDB.

So let's get started!

## Our very first production release of FerretDB

We are starting with the biggest one – the very first production release of FerretDB.
Back in April, we released FerretDB v1.0 to lots of excitement and support from the open source community.
We instantly got many early adopters who were eager to try out FerretDB for their applications; we also got lots of feedback, feature requests, bug reports, and a host of contributors that were super helpful in making FerretDB better.

## New architecture, more backends

In April 2023, we released the first production version of FerretDB.
Since then, we've made several changes to the FerretDB architecture to make it easier to support more backends.

Apart from the [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) backend support, we added support for the [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) backend, and we're currently working on adding support for other backends.
For instance, support for MySQL has been one of the most popular feature requests to date and with the support of the open source community, we've been working on it and we're getting closer to making it available.
Work is also ongoing to support SAP Hana.

## Community stats

A key highlight of our year was the ever-increasing number of FerretDB downloads on [gchr.io](https://github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/pkgs/container/ferretdb) (24.8k) and [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/ferretdb/ferretdb/tags) (600+).
And if you're interested in running a managed FerretDB service, it is also possible with [Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com/en/betas/#managed-document-database), [Civo](https://www.civo.com/marketplace/FerretDB), and [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/docs/ferretdb-managed-database-guide/).
We are excited to see more people try FerretDB and let us know what they think.

We also crossed 8000 stars on GitHub, and we can't wait to see the community grow to even greater numbers next year.

From the start of this project, we've had a host of contributors to FerretDB, and we're grateful for all the support we've received, especially from the open source community.
This was evident in the high number of contributors we had during the last Hacktoberfest event.
Your contributions to code, documentation, bug reports, and feature requests have been very significant.

Many people also wrote about FerretDB and its usage within their application – it's just amazing to see all the possibilies a truly open source MongoDB alternative can bring to the community.

## Events and conferences across the world

Community is at the center of everything we do, and this year, we've been a part of some truly amazing conferences and open source gatherings across many countries.
We've been to the UK, Portugal, Morocco, Serbia, Turkey, and the US, and we've met many amazing people and made new friends.

We were at Civo Navigate 2023 in London, Postgres Ibiza 2023, Percona University, ATO 2023, just to name a few.

## What's to come in 2024

Our mission is clear – to bring MongoDB workloads back to open source.
We've made significant progress towards this goal, and we're very excited about what's to come in 2024.

FerretDB is the driving force behind the creation of an open standard for document databases.

A little over two years ago, we started FerretDB with the goal to bring the same kind of freedom to document databases as we have with relational databases.
Think about it: if you know SQL, you have a vast array of products to use it with.

FerretDB is at the forefront of bringing the community together to establish an Open Standard for document databases and aims to become the best implementation of this future standard.

We need a standard for document databases like SQL is for relational databases.

Open Standards play a crucial role in promoting innovation, providing freedom to users, and facilitating seamless interoperability across various products.
They eliminate vendor lock-in and duplicate efforts in software development.

SQL became an Open Standard due to these advantages, and we are committed to replicating this success for MongoDB.

We can't wait to see what 2024 brings for FerretDB and the open source community.
We wish you all a fantastic holiday season and an amazing New Year!
