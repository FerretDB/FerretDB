![FerretDB v0.9.1 - Minor Release](/img/blog/ferretdb-v0.9.1.jpg)

Since their inception in the 1960s, databases have undergone significant changes, with relational databases like Oracle, MySQL, and PostgreSQL becoming more popular.

These platforms use a Structured Query Language (SQL) to store and retrieve table-based data records.
However, SQL-based storage and retrieval models are not always sufficient for handling records with unstructured information and heavy workloads, particularly for organizations with scalability needs.

To address these needs, NoSQL databases emerged as a solution for companies seeking databases with flexible schema support.
One of these NoSQL databases is the document database.

In this article, we will discuss what document databases are, their unique features, and use cases.

## What is a Document Database?

Document databases – or document-oriented databases – are a type of NoSQL database that stores data as JSON-like documents instead of rows, columns, and tables commonly associated with traditional SQL databases.

Document databases appeal to most developers due to their similarities to objects in programming techniques.
Their flexibility makes them suitable for semi-structured and flexible data that allows them to adapt to a company's evolving needs.

## Understanding Documents Data Model

Documents are at the heart of everything in a document database.
They represent a single record of information about an object and any associated metadata, all stored as key-value pairs of data, containing various data types such as numbers, strings, objects, arrays, etc.
These documents can be stored in various formats, such as JSON, BSON, YAML, or XML.

For instance, the following is a typical example of a document containing information on a book:

```js
{
 title: "The Lord of the Rings",
 author: {
   name: "J.R.R. Tolkien",
   nationality: "British",
 },
 publication_date: "July 29, 1954",
 publisher: "George Allen & Unwin",
 genre: ["High Fantasy", "Adventure"],
 isbn: "978-0618640157",
 number_of_pages: 1178,
 has_movie_adaptation: true,
 movie_adaptation: {
   director: "Peter Jackson",
   release_date: "December 19, 2001",
   awards: ["Best Picture", "Best Director", "Best Adapted Screenplay"],
   box_office: "$1.19 billion"
 },
}
```

In the example, we can see how different types of document data are used to represent various aspects of the book, such as its author, publication information, genre, and movie adaptation.
This flexibility and expressiveness make document databases a popular choice for storing and managing data in modern applications.
Moreover, NoSQL databases usually don't need a fixed schema, so they can accommodate new data types without requiring extensive modification.

## Benefits of Document Databases

There are clear strengths and weaknesses with document databases, and it depends from application to application whether the document model is the right fit.
The following are advantages of the document model with considerable trade-offs.

### Flexible Database Schema

NoSQL databases are incredibly flexible compared to relational databases.
Each document is a separate entity with its own structure, making it easier to query data and make changes that enable the application to evolve over time.
There is no need to modify all existing records to accommodate a new structure.

### High Scalability

By leveraging a document database, you can enable low-cost horizontal scaling, as opposed to vertical scaling, which poses inherent limitations.
Because document databases collocate related data in a single document, sharding datasets is a common strategy for minimizing host-to-host coordination.

Document databases emphasize performance and availability, letting you balance consistency with performance, contrary to relational databases, where consistency is always the top priority.

### Agility

Document databases offer a faster and more flexible way to manage and create databases.
Developers can start building a database with collections of documents immediately, and they can modify it as they build their applications.
With collections of documents that can be populated right away, you don’t need to know the structure of the database.
Instead, developers can get started with their database as soon as possible.

## Document Databases vs. Relational Databases

In a relational database, data is structured in separate tables defined by the programmer so that the same object appears in multiple tables.
To get the desired result from the database, you must use join statements.

On the other hand, you can use a document database to store data for all the information about an object as a single database instance, although each object may differ significantly from the others.

Here is a comparison table between document databases and relational databases:

| Feature     | Document Databases                                                                                                     | Relational Databases                                                                    |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Structure   | Flexible schema design, documents can have different structures within the same collection                             | Predefined, rigid structure with tables, columns, and rows                              |
| Scalability | Efficient horizontal scaling, allowing for easy distribution of data across multiple hosts                             | Vertical scaling, adding resources to a single machine to handle more data              |
| Querying    | Rich querying capabilities, with support for complex nested data structures                                            | Limited support for querying nested data structures, with more focus on join operations |
| Development | Developer-friendly, with a more intuitive data model for object-oriented programming languages                         | Less intuitive data model, more complex SQL queries required                            |
| Consistency | Lower consistency guarantees, with more focus on performance and availability                                          | Higher consistency guarantees, with more focus on data integrity and accuracy           |
| Use Cases   | Best for handling large volumes of semi-structured or unstructured data, suited for modern web and mobile applications | Best for handling structured data, suited for traditional business applications         |
