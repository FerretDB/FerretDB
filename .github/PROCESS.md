# The Process

This file contains some process notes for FerretDB Inc. engineers and long-term contributors.
If you are a community contributor, feel free to ignore all this!
We will do all that for you so you can focus on what is really interesting for you.

This guide tries to be short and does not mention things that are completely automated by our tooling.

## Pull requests

1. Send pull requests from forks; do not make personal branches in the main repository.
   This way, we are similar to community members and could notice similar problems that we could fix for everyone,
   not just for us.
2. Pull request **title** should be accurate and descriptive as it is used in the generated changelog.
   It should not mention the issue number but describe the fixed issue instead.
3. Most of the time pull requests are related to some issues.
   In such cases pull request **description** should mention the issue number like `#123`.
   Do not use URLs like `https://github.com/org/repo/issue/123` even if they are rendered the same on GitHub.
   If you propose a tiny fix, there is no needed to create a new issue.
4. We provide a pull requests template that includes suggestions and readiness checklist.
5. Please create a draft pull request as soon as you start working on an issue; that is needed for our process tooling.
   Once it is ready for review, please mark it as such.
   After that, there is no need to switch between draft and non-draft states.
6. Please don't forget to click "re-request review" buttons once PR is ready for re-review.
7. Commit messages (both titles and bodies) are not important and can be "WIP" or anything else.
   All commits are always squashed on merge by GitHub, so there is no need to squash them manually, amend them, and/or do force pushes.
   Autogenerated GitHub's squash commit's body should be manually replaced by "Refs #{issue_number}." or "Closes #{issue_number}.".
   Do not leave original commit messages in the squashed commit body.
