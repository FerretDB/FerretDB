Pull Request checklist:
- [ ] linters passed
- [ ] all funcs and variables should be documented
- [ ] comments should answer on question why
- [ ] code similarity
- [ ] code cyclomatic complexity
- [ ] code complexity
- [ ] no copy of licensed projects documentation
- [ ] no copy of licensed projects' source code
- [ ] prefer "atomic" tests for separate methods. It's easier to read and understand.
- [ ] code generation functions must not break protocols (stringer comments for string value constants in protocols)
- [ ] use spell-checkers to check grammar and spelling.
- [ ] code coverage
- [ ] a reference to variable names and descriptions
- [ ] no extra test coverage - see the principle of having less code for simplicity and removing the artificial complexity.
- [ ] remove named parameters that we don't use
- [ ] should not treat fluky tests as lightly ok
- [ ] sort alphabetically linters and bulks of variables
- [ ] for specific types use one order everywhere.
- [ ] godoc should look OK, check with `godoc -index -play -timestamps -http=127.0.0.1:6060`
- [ ] documentation must be updated to corresponded changes.
- [ ] variable names, function names etc should tell us themselves what do they do, be clear and not misleading (Code Complete by Steve McConnel)
- [ ] code smells removed (long varible names, long parameter list, repeating code etc) https://refactoring.guru/
- [ ] big functions also should be extracted into smaller ones
