# Indexes

Indexes are essential in improving query performance by enabling fast retrieval of relevant documents when querying large collections.

Indexes in FerretDB are created based on a specific field(s) within documents.
Creating an index involves having a data structure that maps the values in the indexed fields to the locations of the related documents, making it possible to retrieve documents more quickly based on those fields.

## How to create indexes

Use the `createIndexes()` command to create an index on a collection.
You can use the `createIndex()` method to call the `createIndexes()` command.

The `createIndexes()` command takes two arguments: a document containing the index key (fields to index and direction - either ascending or descending), and an optional document specifying the index options.

You can create single field indexes or compound indexes.

### Single field indexes

Suppose a `products` collection contains the following documents:

```json5
{ _id: 1, name: "iPhone 12", category: "smartphone", price: 799 }
{ _id: 2, name: "iPad Pro", category: "tablet", price: 999 }
{ _id: 3, name: "Galaxy S21", category: "smartphone", price: 699 }
{ _id: 4, name: "MacBook Pro", category: "laptop", price: 1299 }
```

Here's an example of the `createIndex` method to create an index on the `price` field of a `products` collection:

```js
db.products.createIndex({ price: 1 })
```

This creates an ascending index on the `price` field.

:::note
`1` specifies the index direction for ascending order.
If it's `-1`, it specifies a descending order direction for the index.
:::

### Compound indexes

For compound indexes, you can create an index key combining multiple fields together as a key.
Below is an example of a compound index that uses `price` and `category` fields
from the `products` collection as the index key:

```js
db.products.createIndex({ price: 1, category: 1 })
```

### Unique indexes

You can create unique indexes to ensure that the indexed fields do not contain duplicate values.
To create a unique index, set the `unique` option as `true` when calling `createIndexes()` command.

Below is an example of a unique index for the `name` field from the `products` collection:

```js
db.products.createIndex({ name: 1 }, { unique: true })
```

Unique indexes can be compound.
Here is an example of a unique index consisting
of the `category` and `name` fields from the `products` collection:

```js
db.products.createIndex({ category: 1, name: 1 }, { unique: true })
```

### Index creation details

- If the `createIndexes()` command is called for a non-existent collection, it will create the collection and its given indexes.
- If the `createIndexes()` command is called for a non-existent field, an index for the field is created without creating or adding the field to an existing collection.
- If you attempt to create an index with the same name and key as an existing index, the system will not create a duplicate index.
  Instead, it will simply return the name and key of the existing index, since duplicate indexes would be redundant and inefficient.
- Meanwhile, any attempt to call `createIndexes()` command for an existing index using the same name and different key, _or_ different name but the same key will return an error.

## How to list indexes

To display a collection's index details, use the `listIndexes()` command.
You can also use the `getIndexes()` method to call the `listIndexes()` command.

To return the list of indexes in the `products` collection, use the following command:

```js
db.products.getIndexes()
```

The returned indexes should look like this, showing the default index, single field index, and compound index.

```js
{
  cursor: {
    id: Long("0"),
    ns: 'db.products',
    firstBatch: [
      { v: 2, key: { _id: 1 }, name: '_id_' },
      { v: 2, key: { price: 1 }, name: 'price_1' },
      {
        v: 2,
        key: { price: 1, category: 1 },
        name: 'price_1_category_1'
      }
    ]
  },
  ok: 1
}
```

## How to drop indexes

You can also drop all the indexes or a particular index in a specified collection, except the default index (`_id`).

FerretDB supports the use of the `dropIndexes()` command.
You can also use the `dropIndex()` method to call the `dropIndexes()` command to a particular index from a collection.

Using the returned indexes above, let's drop the index with the name `price_1`.

```js
db.products.dropIndex('price_1')
```

Another way to perform this action is to use the same index document as the index you want to drop.
For the same example above, you can rewrite it as:

```js
db.products.dropIndex({ price: 1 })
```

Using the `dropIndexes()` command, specify the index as `"*"` to remove all indexes from the collection, except the `_id` index.

```js
db.products.dropIndexes('*')
```

This will drop all the non-`_id` indexes from the collection.
