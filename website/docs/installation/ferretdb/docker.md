# Docker

We provide three Docker images for various deployments:

- **an evaluation image**: for quick testing and experiments
- **a development image**: for debugging problems
- **a production image**: for all other cases

An evaluation image is documented [separately](../evaluation.md).
The rest are covered below.

All Docker images include a [`HEALTHCHECK` instruction](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/#healthcheck)
that behaves like a [readiness probe](../../configuration/observability.md#probes).

## Production image

Our [production image](https://ghcr.io/ferretdb/ferretdb:2) (`ghcr.io/ferretdb/ferretdb:2`) is recommended for most deployments.
It does not include a PostgreSQL image with DocumentDB extension, so you must run this [pre-packaged PostgreSQL image with DocumentDB extension](https://ghcr.io/ferretdb/postgres-documentdb:16) (`ghcr.io/ferretdb/postgres-documentdb:16`) separately.
You can do that with Docker Compose, Kubernetes, or any other means.

### PostgreSQL Setup with Docker Compose

The following steps describe a quick local setup:

1. Store the following in the `docker-compose.yml` file:

   <!-- TODO https://github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/issues/4726 -->

   ```yaml
   services:
     postgres:
       image: ghcr.io/ferretdb/postgres-documentdb:16
       platform: linux/amd64
       restart: on-failure
       environment:
         - POSTGRES_USER=username
         - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
         - POSTGRES_DB=postgres
       volumes:
         - ./data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

     ferretdb:
       image: ghcr.io/ferretdb/ferretdb:2
       restart: on-failure
       ports:
         - 27017:27017
       environment:
         - FERRETDB_POSTGRESQL_URL=postgres://username:password@postgres:5432/postgres

   networks:
     default:
       name: ferretdb
   ```

   `postgres` container runs a pre-packaged PostgreSQL with DocumentDB extension and stores data in the `./data` directory on the host.
   `ferretdb` runs FerretDB.

2. Start services with `docker compose up -d`.
3. If you have `mongosh` installed, just run it to connect to FerretDB.
   It will use credentials passed in `mongosh` flags or MongoDB URI to authenticate to the PostgreSQL database.
   The example URI would look like:

   ```text
   mongodb://username:password@127.0.0.1/
   ```

   See [Authentication](../../security/authentication.md) and
   [Securing connection with TLS](../../security/tls-connections.md) for more details.

   If you don't have `mongosh`, run the following command to run it inside the temporary MongoDB container,
   attaching to the same Docker network:

   ```sh
   docker run --rm -it --network=ferretdb --entrypoint=mongosh mongo "mongodb://username:password@ferretdb/"
   ```

You can improve that setup by:

- [securing connections with TLS](../../security/tls-connections.md);
- adding backups.

- [getting logs](../../configuration/observability.md#docker-logs).

## Development image

The [development image](https://ghcr.io/ferretdb/ferretdb-dev:2) `ghcr.io/ferretdb/ferretdb-dev:2`
contains the [development build](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/v2/build/version#hdr-Development_builds)
of FerretDB with test coverage instrumentation, race detector,
and other changes that make it more suitable for debugging problems.
It can be used exactly the same way as the production image, as described above.
