# `createUser`

import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';


The `createUser` commands helps you create new users for authenticated connections.
It relies on PostgreSQL's authentication mechanisms to manage user credentials.
Read more about [authentication in FerretDB](../../security/authentication.md).

```js
db.runCommand({
  createUser: '<username>',
  pwd: '<password>',
  roles: [
    {
      role: [],
      db: '<database>'
    }
  ]
})
```

:::note
Authorization is not yet supported.
Set `role` as an empty array (`[]`) when creating a user.
:::

## Example

The following example demonstrates how to create a new user with the `createUser` command.

```js
db.runCommand({
  createUser: 'newuser',
  pwd: 'newpassword',
  roles: [
    {
      role: [],
      db: 'test'
    }
    ]
})
```

## Implementation notes and constraints

- The `createUser` command creates a new user in PostgreSQL with the specified username and password.
- The `roles` field is currently not used and should be set as an empty array (`[]`).
- Learn more about authentication in FerretDB in the [authentication documentation](../../security/authentication.md).
