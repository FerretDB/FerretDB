// Package backends provides common interfaces ([Backend], [Database], and [Collection])
// and code for all backend implementations.
//
// # Design principles
//
//  1. Interfaces are designed to balance the efficiency of individual backends and code duplication between them.
//     For example, the `Collection.InsertAll` method creates a database and collection automatically if needed.
//     Theoretically, the handler can make three separate backend calls
//     (create a database if needed, create collection if needed, insert documents),
//     but that implementation would likely be less efficient due to extra roundtrips, transactions, and/or locks.
//     On the other hand, the logic of `ordered` `insert`s is only present in the handler.
//     If some backend supports the same semantics as MongoDB, we will likely add a separate option method,
//     and the handler would use that before falling back to the previous behavior.
//  2. [Backend] objects are stateful.
//     [Database] and [Collection] objects are stateless.
//  3. Backends maintain the list of databases and collections.
//     It is recommended that it does so by not querying the information_schema or equivalent often.
//  4. Contexts are per-operation and should not be stored.
//     They are used for passing authentication information via [conninfo].
//  5. Errors returned by methods could be nil, [*Error], or some other opaque error type.
//     *Error values can't be wrapped or be present anywhere in the error chain.
//     Contracts enforce error codes; they are not documented in the code comments
//     but are visible in the contract's code (to avoid duplication).
//     Methods should return different error codes only if the difference is important for the handler.
//
// # Testing
//
// Backends are mainly tested through FerretDB's integration tests.
// But there are some common tests for all backends that check corner cases in contracts.
// They also test that all backends adjusted to contract changes.
//
// Some backends may have their own tests.
//
// Both kinds of tests could be removed over time as they are replaced by integration tests.
// Prefer integration tests when possible.
