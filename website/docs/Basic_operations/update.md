# Update operation

The update operation modifies a document record in a collection, based on a given query parameter and update.
The `$set` operator assigns the updated record to the document.

## Modify a single document

Use the `updateOne()` method to update a single document in a collection.
This operation filters a collection using a query parameter, and updates given fields within that document.

```sh
db.collection.updateOne({<query-params>}, {$set: {<update fields>}})
```

First, populate the database with a collection containing a list of documents.

```sh
db.scientists.insertMany([{firstname: "Thomas", lastname: "Edison", born: 1847, invention: "LightBulb", nobel:true},{firstname: "Graham", lastname: "Bell", born: 1847, invention: "telephone", nobel:false},{firstname: "Nikola", lastname: "Tesla", born: 1856, invention: "Tesla coil", nobel:false}, {firstname: "Ada", lastname: "Lovelace", born: 1815, invention: "Computer programming", nobel:false}])
```

Using the document record in the collection, update the document where name is `firstname` is "Graham", and set the `firstname` as "Alexander Graham".
The `updateOne()` operation will only affect the first document thatâ€™s retrieved in the collection.

```sh
db.scientists.updateOne({name:"Graham"}, {$set: {name:"Alexander Graham"}})
```

## Modify many documents

Using the `updateMany()` command, you can modify many documents at once.
In the example below, where `nobel` is set as false, update and set to true.

```sh
db.scientists.updateMany({nobel:false}, {$set: {nobel:true}})
```

This operation updates all the documents where the field `nobel` was previously false.

## Replace a document

Besides updating a document, you can replace it completely using the `replaceOne()` method.

```sh
db.league.replaceOne({lastname: "Bell"}, {firstname: "Albert", lastname: "Einstein", born: 1879, invention: "Photoelectric effect", nobel:true})
```
