## [v0.1.0](https://github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/releases/tag/v0.1.0) (2022-04-04)

### What's Changed
In this release, we made a big change in the way FerretDB fetches data from PostgreSQL.

Previously, we generated a single SQL query that extensively used json/jsonb PostgreSQL functions for each incoming MongoDB request, then converted fetched data.
All the filtering was performed by PostgreSQL.
Unfortunately, the semantics of those functions do not match MongoDB behavior in edge cases like comparison or sorting of different types.
That resulted in a difference in behavior between FerretDB and MongoDB, and that is a problem we wanted to fix.

So starting from this release we fetch more data from PostgreSQL and perform filtering on the FerretDB side.
This allows us to match MongoDB behavior in all cases.
Of course, that also greatly reduces performance.
We plan to address it in future releases by pushing down parts of filtering queries that can be made fully compatible with MongoDB.
For example, a simple query like `db.collection.find({_id: 'some-id-value'})` can be converted to SQL `WHERE` condition relatively easy and be compatible even with weird values like IEEE 754 NaNs, infinities, etc.

In short, we want FerretDB to be compatible with MongoDB first and fast second, and we are still working towards the first goal.
