![Relational database vs document database](/img/blog/relational-document.jpg)

Before settling on a database for your application, you want to be sure you're picking the most suitable option available.
Among the key considerations you'll make is deciding between document database or relational database – which is the best fit?

<!--truncate-->

Each option offers distinct advantages tailored to different application needs.
This guide breaks down the differences between relational and document databases, their characteristics, and their use cases.
Would your application be more suited for a relational database (e.g. PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite) or document database (e.g FerretDB, MongoDB, Couchbase)?

Let's dive in to find out more.

## What is a relational database?

Relational databases store data in tables with defined schemas.
Each table is composed of _rows_ and _columns_, where each row represents a data record, and columns hold the data attributes.

Relational databases rely on SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and managing data, with features designed for consistency, data integrity, and complex querying.

Before we go further into the key features of a relational database, let's get into the history and creation of relational databases.

By the 1960s, information systems and data management had become quite complex as businesses started handling large amounts of data – this cost money, time, and extensive technical knowledge.
While they were effective for simple, tree-structured data, they struggled with more complex relationships.

A mathematician and computer scientist, Edgar F. Codd, published a research paper where he proposed a new model for storing data in structured tables.
Data can be queried using structured relationships rather than rigid hierarchical structures.
Codd's relational model became the foundation for relational database management systems (RDBMS) such as Oracle and MySQL, influencing data storage and access practices ever since.

Take an **e-commerce platform** that requires order processing, inventory management, and customer relationship management.
With a relational database like PostgreSQL, the application can organize data into tables for products, customers, orders, and inventory.
The SQL-based relationships between these tables make it easy to manage complex queries, such as retrieving all items ordered by a customer or updating inventory levels when an order is processed.

## Key features of relational databases

- **Defined schema**: Each record must adhere to a predefined schema which helps to ensure data consistency.
  It consists of rows (elements or records) and columns (attributes) of data that are stored in multiple tables.
- **ACID Compliance**: Transactions in relational databases are often ACID-compliant (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).
  ACID is crucial for applications where data accuracy and integrity are essential, such as financial transactions.
- **Complex Querying**: SQL provides powerful capabilities for complex querying, JOINs, and aggregation.
  This is why they excel in use cases where advanced data manipulation and multi-table queries are required.
- **Vertical Scalability**: They typically scale vertically by adding more resources to a single server rather than spreading across multiple servers.

## What is a document database?

With the rise of internet applications in the 2000s, the need to handle unstructured and semi-structured data became more pronounced.

Traditional relational databases encountered limitations with unstructured data and scalability, particularly in distributed environments.
This led to the development of NoSQL databases, including document-oriented databases like MongoDB, which was released in 2009.

A document database or document-oriented database stores data in a flexible, semi-structured format called documents.
They are usually encoded in BSON, XML, or JSON format.

Unlike relational databases with their rigid table-based structure, document databases can include nested structures and varied fields.
These systems were designed to meet the demands of rapidly growing web applications, where data structures often evolve quickly and scale is essential.

Let's consider a social media application where user profiles, posts, and comments need to be stored.
In this case, each profile or post might have nested information like user details, likes, and comments.
Using a document database allows the application to store these complex structures in single unstructured documents that could take any form or data types.

## Key features of document databases

- **Schema Flexibility**: No predefined schema is needed.
  Fields can be added or modified as the application evolves.
- **Data Encapsulation**: Each document encapsulates data as a single entity, reducing the need for JOIN operations, which are common in relational databases.
- **Horizontal Scalability**: Document databases are typically built to scale horizontally, making them ideal for distributed systems and high-availability applications.
- **High Availability**: Built with replication and sharding in mind, document databases are often easier to scale and distribute globally.

## Comparing document databases and relational databases

Here's a quick comparison of the characteristics of document and relational databases:

| Feature                 | Document Database               | Relational Database                   |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Schema**              | Flexible, schema-less           | Fixed, schema-enforced                |
| **Data Model**          | Document-oriented               | Table-based                           |
| **Query Language**      | Custom (often NoSQL)            | SQL                                   |
| **Scaling**             | Horizontal (sharding)           | Vertical (scaling up)                 |
| **Transaction Support** | Limited or eventual consistency | Strong, ACID-compliant                |
| **Flexibility**         | High (adaptable fields)         | Low (structured tables)               |
| **Best for**            | Dynamic and unstructured data   | Structured and highly relational data |
