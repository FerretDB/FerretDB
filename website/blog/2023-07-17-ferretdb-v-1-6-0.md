![FerretDB v.1.6.0 - minor release](/img/blog/ferretdb-v1.6.0.jpg)

We've just released FerretDB v1.6.0 which comes with a couple of new features, bug fixes, and enhancements to [FerretDB](https://www.ferretdb.io), especially the implementation of the `ping` command and `getParameter` method for the SQLite backend.

<!--truncate-->

In this release, we've also made several optimizations and resolved issues with some of the previously implemented commands, our integration tests, and among others.

For instance, in the new release, we've made significant improvements to how we handle cursors through the implementation of the `killCursors` command, which should help optimize cursor management, and ensure better resource management and performance.

Let's check out other notable changes in this release!

## New features

In recent weeks, our team has been working to improve the existing beta support for [SQLite backend](https://www.sqlite.org/), and now we've added support for the `ping` command and `getParameter` method in this release.
We're thrilled with these additions and hope you'll find them useful.

## Bug fixes and enhancements

In previous versions, attempting to update a document using the `$set` operator with the same `_id` value resulted in an error.
We've addressed this issue in the latest release; you can now update a document without encountering an error by executing a command like `db.collection.updateOne({_id: 1}, {$set: {_id: 1, a: 1}})`.

We've also resolved a bug with the `findOne()` query, which wasn't correctly translated to the corresponding PostgreSQL query, and also resulted in a significant delay.

## Other changes

As we previously mentioned in the last release, FerretDB will no longer support the [Tigris backend](https://www.tigrisdata.com/).
If you wish to continue using Tigris, please do not update FerretDB beyond v1.5.0.
Earlier FerretDB releases with Tigris support are still [available on GitHub here](https://github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/releases).

We also added more setup instructions for the backend for SQLite in our [README.md](https://github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB#readme).

For a detailed list of all the changes in this release, please see [our release notes](https://github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.6.0).

We appreciate all the support from the open-source community, our contributors, and our partners.
We're always striving to improve every part of FerretDB, so your feedback, suggestions, bug discoveries, and contributions have been extremely valuable.

Don't forget to [reach out to us on any of our community channels](https://docs.ferretdb.io/#community), we'll be delighted to hear from you!
