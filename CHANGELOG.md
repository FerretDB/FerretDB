## [v1.23.0](https://github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.23.0) (2024-07-25)

### What's Changed

#### Embeddable package

This release switches from the [`zap` logging package](https://github.com/uber-go/zap) to the standard [`slog`](https://pkg.go.dev/log/slog).
If the logger was configured by Go programs that import [`github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/ferretdb` package](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/ferretdb), they should configure the `SLogger` field instead.
Setting the old `Logger` field will make the program panic and make the issue immediately noticeable.

The next release will completely remove `zap` and rename `SLogger` to just `Logger`.

#### Initial OpenTelemetry tracing support

This release adds initial support for sending OpenTelemetry traces to the OTLP endpoint.
The set of spans and their attributes is not stable yet and will change over time.

All improvements in observability in this release (OpenTelemetry traces, Kubernetes probes, debug archive)
are documented [there](https://docs.ferretdb.io/configuration/observability/).

#### Experimental Systemd configuration in `.deb` and `.rpm` packages

This release adds initial unit files for `systemd` that auto-start FerretDB.
They are likely to change in the future in incompatible ways; for example, we may switch to using a non-root user.

## [v1.18.0](https://github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.18.0) (2024-01-08)

### What's Changed

#### Capped collections

This release adds support for capped collections.
They can be created as usual using `create` command.
Both `max` (maximum number of documents) and `size` (maximum collection size in bytes) parameters are supported.

#### Tailable cursors

This release adds support for tailable cursors.
Both `tailable` and `awaitData` parameters are supported.

#### OpLog tailing

This release adds support for the basic OpLog functionality.
The main supported use case is Meteor's OpLog tailing.
Replication is not supported yet.

OpLog collection does not exist by default.
To enable OpLog functionality, create a capped collection `oplog.rs` in the `local` database.
Setting replica set name using [`--repl-set-name` flag / `FERRETDB_REPL_SET_NAME` environment variable](https://docs.ferretdb.io/configuration/flags/#general)
might also be needed.

## [v1.13.0](https://github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.13.0) (2023-10-23)

### What's Changed

#### New PostgreSQL backend

The new PostgreSQL backend is now enabled by default.
You can still enable the old backend with `--postgresql-old` flag or `FERRETDB_POSTGRESQL_OLD=true` environment variable,
but it will be removed in the next release.

#### Default SQLite directory for Docker images

Our Docker images (but not binaries and `.deb` / `.rpm` packages) now use `/state` directory for the SQLite backend.
That directory is also a Docker volume, so data will be preserved after the container restart by default.

#### `arm/v7` packages

We now provide `linux/arm/v7` binaries, Docker images, and `.deb` / `.rpm` packages.

## [v1.5.0](https://github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.5.0) (2023-07-03)

### What's Changed

This release provides beta-level support for the SQLite backend.
There is some missing functionality, but it is ready for early adopters.

This release provides improved cursor support, enabling commands like `find` and `aggregate` to return large data sets much more effectively.

Tigris data users: Please note that this is the last release of FerretDB which includes support for the Tigris backend.
Starting from FerretDB v1.6.0, Tigris will not be supported.
If you wish to use Tigris, please do not update FerretDB beyond v1.5.0.
This and earlier versions of FerretDB with Tigris support will still be available on GitHub.
