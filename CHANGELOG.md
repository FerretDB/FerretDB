# Changelog

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD024 MD034 -->

## [v1.14.0](https://github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.14.0) (TBD)

### What's Changed

#### Old PostgreSQL backend

Is removed.

## [v1.13.0](https://github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.13.0) (2023-10-23)

### What's Changed

#### New PostgreSQL backend

The new PostgreSQL backend is now enabled by default.
You can still enable the old backend with `--postgresql-old` flag or `FERRETDB_POSTGRESQL_OLD=true` environment variable,
but it will be removed in the next release.

#### Default SQLite directory for Docker images

Our Docker images (but not binaries and `.deb` / `.rpm` packages) now use `/state` directory for the SQLite backend.
That directory is also a Docker volume, so data will be preserved after the container restart by default.

#### `arm/v7` packages

We now provide `linux/arm/v7` binaries, Docker images, and `.deb` / `.rpm` packages.

## [v1.5.0](https://github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/releases/tag/v1.5.0) (2023-07-03)

### What's Changed

This release provides beta-level support for the SQLite backend.
There is some missing functionality, but it is ready for early adopters.

This release provides improved cursor support, enabling commands like `find` and `aggregate` to return large data sets much more effectively.

Tigris data users: Please note that this is the last release of FerretDB which includes support for the Tigris backend.
Starting from FerretDB v1.6.0, Tigris will not be supported.
If you wish to use Tigris, please do not update FerretDB beyond v1.5.0.
This and earlier versions of FerretDB with Tigris support will still be available on GitHub.
