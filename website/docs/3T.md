<!--
    blah blah blah
-->

[Studio 3T](https://studio3t.com/) is an IDE, client and a set of GUI tools for
MongoDB. Studio 3T can also be used with FerretDB with certain limitations outlined below.

## Connecting Studio 3T to FerretDB

Go to the Studio 3T [Connection Manager](https://studio3t.com/knowledge-base/articles/connect-to-mongodb/) and select New Connection:

FerretDB currently supports PLAIN authentication so please select LDAP (PLAIN) -
Studio 3T Ultimate in the Authentication tab if you need to authenticate to the
database.

You may also choose to specify a connection URI by clicking New Connection and pasting your connection URI. Please use the [Standard Connection String Format](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/#standard-connection-string-format). See below as an example which connects to localhost on port 27017 using the PLAIN authentication mechanism.
