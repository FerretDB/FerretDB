# Writing guide

## File names

Use `kebab-case-with-dashes` instead of `snake_case_with_underscores` for file names because URL paths typically use dashes.

## Links

Please use markdown file paths for links, not URL paths,
because it works for both editors/IDEs (Ctrl/âŒ˜+click works) and Docusaurus.
Always add `.md` extension to the file paths.
Examples:

* [file in the same directory](contributing.md)
* [file in a parent directory](../telemetry.md)
