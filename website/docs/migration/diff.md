<!--
   Each numbered point should have a corresponding, numbered test file https://github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/tree/main/integration/diff_*_test.go
   Bullet subpoints should be in the same file as the parent point.

   This comment should not be on top to avoid showing on a DocCard: https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/10589.
