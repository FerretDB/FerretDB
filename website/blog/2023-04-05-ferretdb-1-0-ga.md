![FerretDB v1.0 GA](/img/blog/ferretdb-v1.0.jpg)

On behalf of the FerretDB team, we are delighted to announce the release of FerretDB 1.0 GA.

<!--truncate-->

This release is a tremendous milestone representing all the efforts and hard work our amazing team has put in over the past year.
Additionally, we're grateful for the community's overwhelming support, contributions, and feedback since we began this undertaking.

Our mission remains the same: to provide a truly Open Source alternative to MongoDB.
With this release, we consider FerretDB to be production-ready: we will not be introducing breaking changes to ensure backward compatibility.

FerretDB 1.0 GA includes all the core functionality of a document database for production use.
It has improved performance and stability over previous releases.

## How to get started

You can quickly [get started here](https://docs.ferretdb.io/quickstart-guide/).
- on prem 
- cloud (civo cloud, with 1.0 available shortly)

## Going from Beta to FerretDB 1.0 GA

With [FerretDB](https://www.ferretdb.io/), you have an easy-to-use, developer-friendly, open-source, and production-ready replacement for MongoDB workloads.

Since our Beta release in January, we‚Äôve added some notable features such as client TLS validation, support for aggregation pipelines, authentication for PostgreSQL, and Tigris authentication.
In the meantime, we've also pushed more queries to the backend, optimizing them for faster performance.

Along with improved database backend support for [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [Tigris](https://www.tigrisdata.com/), there is ongoing work to add support for SQLite and [SAP HANA](https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/hana.html).

In addition, we‚Äôre also improving compatibility and enabling more applications, such as [Mingo](https://mingo.io/), [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/), [NoSQLBooster](https://nosqlbooster.com/), and [Studio 3T](https://studio3t.com/), to leverage FerretDB functionality.

We are proud to announce that FerretDB now has:

* üë®üèª‚Äçüíª Over 40 code contributors with more than 130 merged pull requests from our community
* ‚≠êÔ∏è over 5300 Stars on GitHub
* üî• Over 100 running instances with telemetry enabled
* ‚è´ Over 10000 FerretDB downloads

Let‚Äôs look at some of the latest features and changes in this GA release.

## What‚Äôs new?

In this GA release, FerretDB now supports the `createIndexes` command.
This will enable you to specify the fields you want to index, and also the type of index to use (e.g. ascending, descending, or hashed).

For instance, suppose you have a `users` collection containing several fields, including "age", "name", and "email", and you want to create an index on the "age" field.
You can now run the following command:

```js
db.users.createIndex({ age: 1 })
```

This will create an ascending index on the "age" field, which will speed up any queries that filter on that field.

We've also added the `dropIndexes` command, which allows you to remove an index from a collection.
Here's an example:

```js
db.users.dropIndex({ age: 1 })
```

This will remove the index from the "users" collection.

We have expanded our aggregation pipeline functionality to include additional stages, such as `$unwind`, `$limit` and `$skip`, in addition to the `$sum` accumulator within the `$group` stage.
With these additions, we can perform more refined calculations and manipulations of collection data.
In addition to these, we also added support for `count` and `storageStats` fields in `$collStats` aggregation pipeline stage.

To help you gather more information about your collections, databases, and server performance, we've enabled partial support for several server commands, including `collStats`, `dbStats`, and `dataSize`.

To retrieve statistics about a collection, use the `collStats` command like this:

```js
db.runCommand({ collStats: "users" })
```

If the statistics is about the database, run the command below:

```js
db.runCommand({ dbStats: 1 })
```

For the total data size of a collection, run the following command:

```js
db.runCommand({ dataSize: "<database>.<collection>" })
```

TODO (Alexey Palazhchenko) add notes on performance 

## What next

* Future plans after GA
* Appreciation

The release of FerretDB 1.0 is only the first step in our journey to  developing the truly open source document database with MongoDB compatibility.
We are super proud to have a stable foundation to build on, as we work on enhancing the performance and reliability of the database.

We extend our sincerest thanks to our dedicated community of early adopters who provided valuable code contributions, feedback, testing, and encouragement.
We are happy to welcome new members to our growing community and encourage everyone to join us on [GitHub](https://github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/), check out FerretDB, and explore the many possibilities FerretDB has to offer.
We can't wait to see what you build with it.
We look forward to hearing your feedback as we continue to improve FerretDB.
