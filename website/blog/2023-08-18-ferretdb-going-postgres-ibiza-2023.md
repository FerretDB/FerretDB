**There would be no [FerretDB](https://www.ferretdb.io) without [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/). We heavily rely on not just the software, but also its community to make FerretDB happen. It is why Postgres Ibiza is an event that we wouldn't miss this year. Let's meet and spend some amazing time together!**

<!--truncate-->

[Postgres Ibiza](https://pgibz.io/) is a great international community event organized by the Fundación PostgreSQL, a Spanish non-profit organization, part of the Postgres community.
The location is on the splendid island of Ibiza, next to the beach, warm summer weather, and amazing people.

Our CEO, Peter Farkas will have a presentation at the event, titled "**Moving MongoDB Workloads to Postgres with FerretDB.**" We are also proudly sponsoring the event and the PostgreSQL community.

**Postgres Ibiza | Santa Eulalia Des Ríu, Spain | August 29-31** [Join us and grab your tickets here](https://pgibz.io/)

We will share more information on our social media about the event.
