# Data API

The FerretDB Data API is an open-source alternative to the MongoDB Atlas Data API.
It lets you perform MongoDB-compatible operations via HTTP requests, without needing a MongoDB driver.
The Data API is integrated directly into FerretDB â€“ it's not a standalone service.

## Enable the Data API

To access the FerretDB Data API, set the [environment variable or flag](../configuration/flags.md) (`FERRETDB_LISTEN_DATA_API_ADDR`/`--listen-data-api-addr`) to the desired address and port when starting FerretDB.

Suppose you want to run the Data API on port `8080` and your FerretDB instance is running locally on `localhost:27017`, set the environment variable or flag as `FERRETDB_LISTEN_DATA_API_ADDR=:8080` or `--listen-data-api-addr=:8080`.

The Data API will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.
Make sure to provide your authentication credential in the request headers or as part of the URL if authentication is enabled.

## Using the Data API

The Data API supports standard MongoDB operations like `insert`, `find`, `update`, and `delete`.
It follows the [Data API OpenAPI 3.0 specification defined here](https://github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/blob/refs/tags/v2.3.0/internal/dataapi/api/openapi.json).

### Insert a document

To insert a single document, use the `/action/insertOne` endpoint.

```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/action/insertOne \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -u <username>:<password> \
  -d '{
        "database": "db",
        "collection": "books",
        "document": {
          "_id": "pride_prejudice_1813",
          "name": "Pride and Prejudice",
          "authors": [{ "name": "Jane Austen", "nationality": "British" }],
          "publication": {
            "date": "1813-01-28T00:00:00Z",
            "publisher-name": "T. Egerton"
          }
        }
      }'
```

### Find a document

Use the `/action/findOne` endpoint to retrieve documents.

```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/action/findOne \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -u <username>:<password> \
  -d '{
        "database": "db",
        "collection": "books",
        "filter": { "_id": "pride_prejudice_1813" }
      }'
```

### Update a document

To update a document, use the `/action/updateOne` endpoint.

```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/action/updateOne \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -u <username>:<password> \
  -d '{
        "database": "db",
        "collection": "books",
        "filter": { "_id": "pride_prejudice_1813" },
        "update": { "$set": { "isbn": "9780141439518" } }
      }'
```

### Delete a document

To delete a document, use the `/action/deleteOne` endpoint.

```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/action/deleteOne \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -u <username>:<password> \
  -d '{
        "database": "db",
        "collection": "books",
        "filter": { "_id": "pride_prejudice_1813" }
      }'
```

## Import the Data API Specification into API Clients

The FerretDB Data API is compatible with OpenAPI 3.0, allowing you to import the API specification into various API clients like Postman, Insomnia, or Swagger UI.
Below is an example using Postman.

Import the FerretDB Data API specification into Postman using the following URL:

```text
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/refs/tags/v2.3.0/internal/dataapi/api/openapi.json
```

This will load available endpoints into Postman, as shown below:

Using the same examples from earlier, you can now test the endpoints directly in Postman.

Make sure to set the `{{baseURL}}` variable to the URL you configured for the Data API (`http://localhost:8080` in this case).
You can also set up environment variables in Postman for the `<username>` and `<password>` to avoid hardcoding them in the requests.
See the [Postman documentation](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/environment-variables/) for more information on how to set up environment variables.

Image below shows an example of the `insertOne` endpoint in Postman:
