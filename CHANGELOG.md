### New Contributors

[All closed issues and pull requests](https://github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/milestone/73?closed=1).
[All commits](https://github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/compare/v2.1.0...v2.2.0).

## [v2.1.0](https://github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/releases/tag/v2.1.0) (2025-04-03)

This version works only with
[DocumentDB v0.102.0-ferretdb-2.1.0](https://github.com/FerretDB/documentdb/releases/tag/v0.102.0-ferretdb-2.1.0).

### Breaking changes

<!-- textlint-disable one-sentence-per-line -->

> [!CAUTION]
> Please note that due to incompatibilities in our previous releases, DocumentDB can't be updated in place,
> even with a manual `ALTER EXTENSION UPDATE` query or other means.
> A new clean installation into an empty data directory/volume is required.
> All data should be backed up with `mongodump`/`mongoexport` before and restored
> with `mongorestore`/`mongoimport` after.
> [See our blog post for more details](https://blog.ferretdb.io/ferretdb-v210-release-performance-improvements-bug-fixes/).
>
> We expect future updates to be much smoother.

## [v2.0.0-rc.2](https://github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/releases/tag/v2.0.0-rc.2) (2025-02-25)

This version works best with
[DocumentDB v0.102.0-ferretdb-2.0.0-rc.2](https://github.com/FerretDB/documentdb/releases/tag/v0.102.0-ferretdb-2.0.0-rc.2).

### Breaking changes

The `:latest` Docker image tag now points to this release.
It is highly recommended always to specify the full version (like `:2.0.0-rc.1`).

### What's Changed

#### Docker images

Docker images are again available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ferretdb/ferretdb)
and [quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/ferretdb/ferretdb)
(although we recommend using [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/ferretdb/FerretDB/pkgs/container/ferretdb)).

#### Embeddable Go package

Once again, FerretDB can be used as a [Go library](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/v2/ferretdb).

#### `.deb` packages for DocumentDB

`.deb` packages for DocumentDB are now available [there](https://github.com/FerretDB/documentdb/releases).
