# Changelog

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD024 MD034 -->

## [v2.0.0-rc.2](https://github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/releases/tag/v2.0.0-rc.2) (2025-02-25)

This version works best with
[DocumentDB v0.102.0-ferretdb-2.0.0-rc.2](https://github.com/FerretDB/documentdb/releases/tag/v0.102.0-ferretdb-2.0.0-rc.2).

### Breaking changes

The `:latest` Docker image tag now points to this release.
It is highly recommended always to specify the full version (like `:2.0.0-rc.1`).

### What's Changed

#### Docker images

Docker images are again available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ferretdb/ferretdb)
and [quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/ferretdb/ferretdb)
(although we recommend using [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/ferretdb/FerretDB/pkgs/container/ferretdb)).

#### Embeddable Go package

Once again, FerretDB can be used as a [Go library](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/v2/ferretdb).

#### `.deb` packages for DocumentDB

`.deb` packages for DocumentDB are now available [there](https://github.com/FerretDB/documentdb/releases).

#### Indexes

Multiple issues with indexes were resolved, and support for TTL indexes was added.
After updating DocumentDB and FerretDB, rebuilding indexes using the `reIndex` command is recommended.
