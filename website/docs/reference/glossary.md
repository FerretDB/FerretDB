See [list of supported aggregation operations and commands here](supported-commands.md#aggregation-pipelines).

#### aggregation pipeline

A set of operators that lets you perform complex operations that aggregate and summarize values.
See [list of supported aggregation pipeline operators](supported-commands.md#aggregation-pipeline-operators) here.

See [telemetry](../telemetry.md) for more details.

#### BSON

See [Documents](../understanding-ferretdb.md#documents) for more.

#### dot notation

Dot notation is used to reference or access the elements in an array or in an embedded document.
See [dot notation](../understanding-ferretdb.md#dot-notation) for more details.

### F

#### field

They are represented as field name-value pairs and describe the kind of data in a document.

---

### I

#### index

The primary key of a documents is stored in the `_id` field, which typically contains the `ObjectId`.

#### proxy

It's used to test differences between FerretDB and other databases.
See [Operation modes](../configuration/operation-modes.md) for more details.

#### PostgreSQL

An open source relational database.
FerretDB uses PostgreSQL as a database engine.
