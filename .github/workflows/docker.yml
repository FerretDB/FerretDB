# This workflow is dangerous and should be handled with great care to avoid security problems.
# See the warning at conform-pr.yml.

# We also tried a different approach: build Docker image in one normal, secure `pull_request` workflow,
# upload artifact, and then download and publish it in another workflow that has access to secrets, but treats
# artifact as passive data. We use buildx for building multi-platform images, and there is a way to export
# multi-platform OCI tarball: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/buildx_build/#output
# Unfortunately, it seems that there is no way to import that tarball in another workflow and publish it
# as a Docker image, as strange as it sounds: https://github.com/docker/buildx/issues/186
