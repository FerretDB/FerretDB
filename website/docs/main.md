# Introduction

FerretDB (formerly MangoDB) is an open-source proxy that translates MongoDB wire protocol
queries to SQL, with PostgreSQL as the database engine.

Initially built as open-source software, MongoDB was a game-changer for many developers,
enabling them to build fast and robust applications.
Its ease of use and extensive documentation made it a top choice for many developers looking
for an open-source database.
However, all this changed when they switched to an SSPL license,
moving away from their open-source roots.

In light of this, FerretDB was founded to become the true open-source alternative to MongoDB,
making it the go-to choice for most MongoDB users looking for an open-source alternative to MongoDB.
With FerretDB, users can run the same MongoDB protocol queries without needing to learn a new language or command.

## Scope and current state

FerretDB is compatible with MongoDB drivers and can be used as a direct replacement for MongoDB 6.0+.

Currently, the project is still in its early stages of development and not yet suitable for use in production-ready environments.
See our [public roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/FerretDB/projects/2/views/1),
a list of [known differences with MongoDB](/diff/),
and [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
