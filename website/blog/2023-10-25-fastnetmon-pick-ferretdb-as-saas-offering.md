FastNetMon LTD is a leading vendor for on-premise DDoS detection for Telecom networks. To reduce the time needed to deploy products when networks are under attack, they're working on a new offering called FastNetMon Cloud, which will allow customers to get traffic visibility and attack detection in a matter of minutes without needing to deploy new hardware and install the product.

To offer the best quality of service and at the same time to keep maintenance costs low we need a database that does not require significant attention from us and offers outstanding performance. At the same time, we need to have trust in the future of the database and see that the database has a clear and very predictable roadmap and a bright future backed by a great team.
