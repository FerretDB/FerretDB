![FerretDB releases v1.14.0](/img/blog/ferretdb-v1.14.0.jpg)

We're happy to announce the release of FerretDB v1.14.0 which includes the implementation of the `compact` command, optimized `insert`, and more.

<!--truncate-->

As we mentioned in our [previous release (v1.13.0)](https://blog.ferretdb.io/ferretdb-v1130-new-postgresql-backend/), we've migrated to the new PostgreSQL backend, and the old PostgreSQL backend code is now completely removed in this release.
If you're unfamiliar with the new PostgreSQL backend, [here's an overview that should help](https://blog.ferretdb.io/ferretdb-v1-10-production-ready-sqlite/#the-new-architecture).

It's been an exciting time at FerretDB and the open source community as we rounded up the last of the Hactoberfest PRs.
We celebrate all the new contributors to FerretDB and their support for a truly open source alternative to MongoDB.
In this latest release, we had 3 new contributors to FerretDB: [@ShatilKhan](https://github.com/ShatilKhan), [@rubiagatra](https://github.com/rubiagatra), and [@gen1us2k](https://github.com/gen1us2k).

Let's check out the new features.

## New features and enhancements

In the latest release, we've implemented the `compact` command.
The command defragments and reorganizes the data within a collection to free up storage and improve efficiency.

We've also optimized `insert` performance by batching, so instead of inserting documents one after the other, the new approach batches multiple documents into a single `Collection.InsertAll` call for both PostgreSQL and SQLite backends.

We're also currently working on supporting capped collections, and we should have more updates on this in future releases, so keep an eye out for it.
