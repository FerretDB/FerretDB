Vector search is a technique for retrieving contextual and semantically related items based on the similarity of their vector representations.
It operates on numerical vectors, which represent data such as text, images, or audio.
These vectors, known as **vector embeddings**, are typically generated using embedding models such as Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT, and GPT for text data, ResNet for image data, or Wav2Vec for audio data.

Vector search is widely used in various applications, especially to power generative AI workflows, such as conversational agents and chatbots.
It is also used for building recommendation systems for personalized content and product suggestions, and to enable semantic search for context-aware document retrieval.

## Vector indexes

Every vector search application requires a method to calculate the similarity between two vectors.
Similarity metrics such as Cosine similarity and Euclidean distance help calculate the distance between vectors and are essential for finding the nearest neighbors of a query from the same embedding model.

FerretDB supports the following vector index kinds:

- **Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW)**: HNSW is a graph-based index that uses a hierarchical structure to store vectors, suitable for high-speed vector search in memory.
- **Inverted File (IVF)**: IVF is an inverted file index that partitions the vector space (data sets) into clusters (inverted lists) and performs approximate nearest neighbor search within selected clusters.

## Creating an index

Vector index can be created using the usual `createIndexes` command with the following syntax:

<CodeBlock language="js">{IndexSyntax}</CodeBlock>

A vector index definition can take the following parameters, depending on the kind of index:

| Field                 | Type     | Description                                                                                                                                                    | Index kind |

| `similarity`          | string   | The similarity metric to use for nearest neighbor search. Option could be `COS` for cosine similarity, `L2` for Euclidean distance, or `IP` for inner product. | All        |
| `dimensions`          | integer  | The number of dimensions in the vector. Note that all vectors in the collection must have the same dimensionality. Must range from 2-16000                     | All        |
|                       |          |                                                                                                                                                                |            |

### Index creation example

In the following sections, we will demonstrate how to create and use vector indexes by inserting the following documents with vector embeddings into a collection:

<CodeBlock language="js">{MyDataSet}</CodeBlock>

The `vector` field represents the vector embeddings generated for the `summary` field using the [SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L6-v2") model](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2).
You can use any embedding model to generate the vectors.

<Tabs groupId="kind">

<TabItem value="hnsw" label="HNSW" default>

To create an HNSW index, set the `kind` field to `vector-hnsw` when creating the vector index.

<CodeBlock language="js">{HNSWIndex}</CodeBlock>

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="ivf" label="IVF">

To create an IVF index, set the `kind` field to `vector-ivf` when creating the vector index.

<CodeBlock language="js">{IVFIndex}</CodeBlock>

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Performing a vector search

Once an index is created, you can perform vector searches using the `$search` stage in the aggregation pipeline:

<CodeBlock language="js">{SearchSyntax}</CodeBlock>

A typical vector search query includes the query vector, the path to the field containing the vector, and the number of neighbors to return, as described below:

| Field          | Type     | Description                                                                                                  | Applicable Index |
| -------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| `cosmosSearch` | document | An operator that specifies query parameters (`vector`, `path`, `k`, `efSearch`, etc.) for the vector search. | All              |
| `vector`       | array    | The vector to search for.                                                                                    | All              |
| `path`         | string   | The path to the field containing the vector.                                                                 | All              |
| `k`            | integer  | The number of neighbors (results) to return.                                                                 | All              |
|                |          |                                                                                                              |                  |
| `efSearch`     | integer  | The number of neighbors or dynamic candidate list to search (default: 40). Must range from 1 to 1000         | HSNW             |

### Vector search example

<Tabs groupId="kind">

<TabItem value="hnsw" label="HNSW" default>

Using the same embedding model used for generating the vectors, a query vector is generated for `An exciting tale of adventure and exploration at sea`.
Next, a vector search is performed on the `vector` field in the `books` collection to find the two nearest neighbors of the query vector.

<CodeBlock language="js">{HSNWSearch}</CodeBlock>

The query returns the two nearest neighbors of the query vector.

<CodeBlock language="json">{HNSWSearchResponse}</CodeBlock>

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="ivf" label="IVF">

Using the embeddings model used for generating the vectors, a query vector is generated for `"A science fiction tale exploring the boundaries of human knowledge"`.
The following aggregation query performs a vector search on the `vector` field in the `books` collection:

<CodeBlock language="js">{IVFSearch}</CodeBlock>

By setting `returnStoredSource: true`, the query returns the similarity score along with matching documents.
Otherwise, only the similarity score is returned, and the actual document content is excluded.

The query returns the two nearest neighbors of the query vector.

<CodeBlock language="json">{IVFSearchResponse}</CodeBlock>

</TabItem>

</Tabs>
