![FerretDB v.1.7.0 release](/img/blog/ferretdb-v1.7.0.jpg)

We are delighted to announce the release of FerretDB v1.7.0 with the implementation of the `$sum` aggregator standard operator, as well as basic metrics, logging, and tracing for the SQLite backend.

<!--truncate-->

Community is the core of everything we do at [FerretDB](https://www.ferretdb.io), so we are pretty excited to have two new first-time contributors, [@Aditya1404Sal](https://github.com/Aditya1404Sal) and [@KrishnaSindhur](https://github.com/KrishnaSindhur), whose contributions were important to this release.

Let's find out more about this release.

## New features

In FerretDB v1.7.0, we've added support for the standard `$sum` operator; this is different from the previously implemented `$sum` as an accumulation operator, which behaves differently when used in other stages.
Now you can use the standard `$sum` operator consistently in any of our supported stages, for aggregation projection, query projection, and for `$group` stage `_id` expression.

We've also added basic metrics, logging, and tracing for the SQLite backend, which should provide more visibility and control to your databases.

## Bug fixes and documentation

There was an error when opening a connection with the MongoDB client in C#, but we've resolved it now by fixing PLAIN authentication with the C# driver.
We've improved the [FerretDB documentation page](https://docs.ferretdb.io/), and now you can find information about SQLite URI parameters, and updated tag formatting in the writing guide.
We've also made it easier to add new linter checks; for example, we included a check for tags with spaces.
