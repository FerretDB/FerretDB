# Update operation

The update operation modifies a document record in a collection, based on a given query parameter and update.
FerretDB supports update operators, such as `$set` and `$setOnInsert` to update documents in a record.

At present, FerretDB currently supports the following update operators:

| Operator name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `$set` | Assigns the value for an updated field to the document. |
| `$setOnInsert` | Specifies the value of a field when an update operation results in the addition of a document.  However, there is no effect when it modifies an existing document. |
| `$unset` | Removes a specific field from a document. |
| `$pop` | In an array, this operator removes the first or last item. |

## Update a single document

Use the `updateOne()` method to update a single document in a collection.
This operation filters a collection using a query parameter, and updates given fields within that document.

```js
db.collection.updateOne({<query-params>}, {$set: {<update fields>}})
```

First, populate the database with a collection containing a list of documents.

```js
db.scientists.insertMany([
   {
        firstname: "Thomas",
        lastname: "Edison",
        born: 1847,
        invention: "LightBulb",
        nobel: true
   },
   {
        firstname: "Graham",
        lastname: "Bell",
        born: 1847,
        invention: "telephone",
        nobel: false
   },
   {
        firstname: "Nikola",
        lastname: "Tesla",
        born: 1856,
        invention: "Tesla coil",
        nobel: false
   },
   {
        firstname: "Ada",
        lastname: "Lovelace",
        born: 1815,
        invention: "Computer programming",
        nobel: false
   }
])
```

Using the document record in the collection, update the document where `firstname` is "Graham", and set it as "Alexander Graham".
The `updateOne()` operation will only affect the first document thatâ€™s retrieved in the collection.

```js
db.scientists.updateOne({
   firstname: "Graham"
},
{
   $set:{
      firstname: "Alexander Graham"
   }
})
```

## Update many documents

Using the `updateMany()` command, you can modify many documents at once.
In the example below, where `nobel` is set as false, update and set to true.

```js
db.scientists.updateMany({nobel:false}, {$set: {nobel:true}})
```

This operation updates all the documents where the field `nobel` was previously false.

### Update an array element

The following update example uses the `employees` collection.
To populate the collection, run the following in your terminal:

```js
db.employees.insertMany([
  {
     name: {
        first: "Earl",
        last: "Thomas"
     },
     employeeID: 1234,
     age: 23,
     role: "salesperson",
     catalog: [
        "printer",
        "cardboard",
        "crayons",
        "books"
     ]
  },
  {
     name: {
        first: "Sam",
        last: "Johnson"
     },
     employeeID: 2234,
     age: 35,
     role: "salesperson",
     catalog: [
        "cabinet",
        "fridge",
        "blender",
        "utensils"
     ]
  },
  {
     name: {
        first: "Clarke",
        last: "Dane"
     },
     employeeID: 3234,
     age: 21,
     role: "salesperson",
     catalog: [
        "printer",
        "pencils",
        "crayons",
        "toys"
     ]
  }
])
```

The folllowing command will query and update the `catalog` array in the `employee` collection using dot notation.
The command will query the second field of the array in every document for `"pencil"`, and when there is a match, updates the first element of the array.

```js
db.employees.updateMany({
    "catalog.1": "pencils"
}, 
{
    $set: {
        "catalog.0": "ruler"
    }
})
```

The response from the command:

```js
{
  acknowledged: true,
  insertedId: null,
  matchedCount: 1,
  modifiedCount: 1,
  upsertedCount: 0
}
```

## Replace a document

Besides updating a document, you can replace it completely using the `replaceOne()` method.

```js
db.scientists.replaceOne({
    lastname: "Bell",
},
{
    lastname: "Einstein",
    firstname: "Albert",
    born: 1879,
    invention: "Photoelectric effect",
    nobel: true
})
```
