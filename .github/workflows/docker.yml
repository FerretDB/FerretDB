# This workflow is dangerous and should be handled with a lot of care to avoid security problems.
# We use `pull_request_target` event to give pull requests access to secrets with permissions to publish Docker images, etc.
# But rogue PR authors could try to steal our secrets.
# We prevent that with the following:
#
# * We require approval for PRs from first-time contributors. That's a built-in feature for all actions.
# * After reviewing changes, we require the `trust` label to be assigned to PRs by FerretDB maintainers.
#   Only a few trusted people have permission to do that.
# * Thanks to the way `pull_request_target` trigger works, PR changes in the workflow itself are not run
#   until they are merged.
# * We use a short-living automatic `GITHUB_TOKEN` instead of a long-living personal access token (PAT).
#   It also has minimal permissions.
# * We publish Docker images from PRs as a separate package that should not be run by users.
# * We limit what third-party actions can be used.
#
# We also tried a different approach: build Docker image in one normal, secure `pull_request` workflow,
# upload artifact, and then download and publish it in another workflow that has access to secrets, but treats
# artifact as passive data. We use buildx for building multi-platform images, and there is a way to export
# multi-platform OCI tarball: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/buildx_build/#output
# Unfortunately, it seems that there is no way to import that tarball in another workflow and publish it
# as a Docker image, as strange as it sounds: https://github.com/docker/buildx/issues/186
